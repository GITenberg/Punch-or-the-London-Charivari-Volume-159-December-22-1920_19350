<p>
It is pointed out that the display of
December meteors is more than usually
lavish. Send a postcard to your M.P.
about it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> recently stated
that the first prize he ever won was for
singing. It is only fair to say that this
happened in the pre-<span class="sc">Northcliffe</span> era.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An elderly Londoner recalls a Christmas
when the cold was so intense that
in a Soho restaurant the ices froze.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There has arrived at the Zoo a bird
akin to the partridge and excellent for
the table, but unable to fly.
The very thing for the estate
of a sporting profiteer.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"What is the best fire preventative?"
asks a weekly
journal. The answer is, the
present price of coal.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The National Rat Campaign
this year, we are told, was a
great success. On the other
hand we gather that several
rats have threatened to issue
a minority report.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"There is nothing so enjoyable,"
says a newspaper correspondent,
"as a trip across
the water to Ireland." Except,
of course, a trip back again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A number of Huns are receiving
Iron Crosses through the
post inscribed "Your Fatherland
does not forget you." How
like Germany! She won't even
allow bygones to be bygones.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Let Christmas come," says a contemporary
headline. We have arranged
to do so.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Minneapolis judge rules that a man
has the right to declare himself head of
the household. Opinion in this country
agrees that he has the right but rarely
the pluck.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"My faith in the League of Nations
is not shaken," says Lord <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span>.
This is the dogged spirit which is going
to make this country what it used to be.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"It may yet be possible," according to
the Water Power Resources Committee,
"to harness the moon." This of course
would depend upon whether Sir <span class="sc">Eric
Geddes</span> would let them have it or not.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Cinema stunt actors, says <i>The Manchester
Guardian</i>, expect to be paid fifty
pounds for a motor smash. It seems
an injustice that ordinary pedestrians
should have to take part in this sort of
thing for nothing.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The continued disappearance of notepaper
from a well-known club has now
been traced to a large female cat, and
most of the paper has been recovered
from her sleeping-basket. It is thought
that she was probably preparing to
write her memoirs.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A burglar who broke into a private
house near Hitchin helped himself to
a good supper before leaving. It is
pleasing to learn, however, that, judging
by the disordered state in which the
pantry was left, the Stilton cheese must
have put up a splendid fight.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was most unfortunate that Mr.
<span class="sc">"Fatty" Arbuckle's</span> visit to London
should have clashed with the Cattle
Show at the Royal Agricultural Hall.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>During a recent revue performance
in London the conductor accidentally
turned over two pages of music at once
and the orchestra suddenly ceased playing.
Several words of the chorus were
actually heard by those sitting in front
before the mistake could be rectified.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Green peas in excellent condition,
says a contemporary, have been picked at
Pentlow, Sussex. It serves them right.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Although Labour extremists are
now much quieter it would take very
little to set the ball of discontent into
motion once again," states a writer in
the Sunday Press. This being so, is
it not rather unwise to let Christmas
Day fall this year on the workmen's
half holiday?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We question the wisdom of drawing
the attention of Parliament to the
silence of the <span class="sc">Poet Laureate</span>. If he
is goaded into breaking it we shall
know whom to blame.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"If people at home only knew how
grateful we are for <i>anything</i> that is
sent us," writes a lady from the island
of Tristan d'Acunha. If they are as
easily pleased as that, the idea of sending
them Lieut.-Commander
<span class="sc">Kenworthy</span> should not be lost
sight of.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The Hexathlon," we read,
"is a form of contest new to
this country." Mind you get
one for the children at Christmas.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A new type of American warship
is expected to be able to
cross the Atlantic in a little
over three days. It will be
remembered that the fastest of
the 1914 lot took nearly three
years.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Large numbers of Filipinos
are resisting an edict requiring
them to wear trousers. Unfortunately
it is impossible to
offer to accommodate them all
in the ranks of the Chicago
Scottish.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Riverside residents remarked
that just before the cold set in
large flocks of seagulls passed up the
Thames. Well, what did they expect?
Flamingoes?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. A. B. <span class="sc">Walkley</span> has remarked
that a prejudice against actors is as old
as the stage. It is satisfactory to think
that it is no older and that in many cases
it may be removed by a change of profession.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"I never dreamed of anything like
this when I invented the telephone,"
said Dr. <span class="sc">Bell</span> after a demonstration.
Neither as a matter of fact did we when
we hired ours.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Owing to the fact that Dr. <span class="sc">Bell</span>
has experienced no unpleasantness
during his stay over here, it is thought
that the American genius who invented
revues may now risk a visit to our
shores.</p>

It is with the deepest sorrow that we record the
death of F. H. Townsend, which occurred, without
any warning, on December 11th. Their personal
loss is keenly felt by his colleagues of the <i>Punch</i>
Table, to whom the fresh candour of his nature
and his brave gaiety of spirit, not less than his
technical skill and resourcefulness, were a constant
delight and will remain an inspiration. As Art Editor
he will be greatly missed by the many contributors
who have been helped by his kindly counsel and
encouragement. Of the gap that he leaves in the
world of Art they are sadly conscious who followed
and appreciated his fine work not only in the
pages of <i>Punch</i>  but in his book-illustrations and
in those appeals for charity to which he always
gave freely of his best.</p>
<p>
To his nearest and dearest among the wide circle
that loved him we ask leave to offer the sympathy
of friends who truly share their grief. With them
we mourn a life untimely closed, and great gifts
lost to us while still in their fulness; but we take
comfort in the thought that death touched him with
swift and gentle hand, and that he died with harness
on, as a man would choose to die.</p>

<h3>"THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT."</h3>

<h4><span class="sc">In Affectionate Memory of F. H. Townsend</span>.</h4>

<p>Only a few days before the sudden tragedy which took
from us our colleague of the <i>Punch</i> Staff, he made me a
small request, very characteristic of his kindly heart. It
was that I should put in these pages a notice of <i>The
Christmas Spirit</i>, the illustrated annual published in aid
of the work of Talbot House ("Toc. H."), in which he had
taken a practical interest. In carrying out his wish I want
not only to plead in behalf of a good cause, but also to
associate this appeal with the memory of one with whom
for over fourteen years I have worked in close and happy
comradeship.</p>

<p>In case any reader of <i>Punch</i> has yet to be introduced to
the idea of Talbot House, let me explain that its purpose
is to carry on in peace-time the work that was done by the
original "Toc. H.," which from 1915 to 1918, under the
management of the Rev. P. R. <span class="sc">Clayton</span>, M.C., Garrison
Chaplain, provided the comforts of a club and rest-house at
Poperinghe for soldiers passing to and fro in the deadly
Salient of Ypres. Its objects&mdash;I quote from <i>The Christmas
Spirit</i>&mdash;are:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"(1) &nbsp;To preserve among ex-Service men and to transmit
to the younger generation the traditions of Christian Fellowship
and Service manifested on Active Service.</p>

<p>(2) &nbsp;To offer opportunities for recreation and the making
of friendships to thousands of men who find life a difficult
salient to hold.</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;To provide opportunities for men of all kinds to come
together in the Spirit of Service, to study, to discuss and,
if possible, to solve the problems of their time.</p>

<p>(4) &nbsp;To offer the help and happiness of club life at a low
rate by establishing clubs in many centres throughout the
country as the focus of the brotherhood."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The noble work done by Talbot House in Poperinghe and
Ypres was gratefully recognised by the scores of thousands
of our troops whose needs it served in those hard days, but
it was only when the War was over that its story was made
known to the public at home in <i>Tales of Talbot House</i>
(<span class="sc">Chatto and Windus</span>), which received a warm welcome in
the review columns of <i>Punch</i>. This was followed recently
by <i>The Pilgrim's Guide to the Ypres Salient</i> (<span class="sc">Reiach</span>), a
little book compiled and written, as a labour of love, entirely
by ex-Service men. Besides being actually a present-day
guide to the Salient, it contains special articles illustrating
the life that was there lived during the War by various
branches of the service. And now we have the annual of
"Toc. H."&mdash;<i>The Christmas Spirit</i>&mdash;to which the <span class="sc">Prince of
Wales</span> has given a foreword and a host of brilliant authors
and artists have freely contributed. Here are <span class="sc">Rudyard
Kipling, Stephen Graham, G. K. Chesterton, E. F. Benson,
Ian Hay, Gilbert Frankau, W. Rothenstein, "Spy,"
Derwent Wood, Heath Robinson</span> and, of <i>Punch</i> artists,
<span class="sc">F. H. Townsend, Lewis Baumer, G. L. Stampa, George
Morrow, G. D. Armour, E. H. Shepard, "Fougasse,"
Wallis Mills</span> and <span class="sc">H. M. Bateman</span>.</p>

<p>The four contributions of <span class="sc">F. H. Townsend</span> include a
"first study" for a drawing that appeared recently in <i>Punch</i>
and a delightful sketch of "The Christmas Spirit," as
typified by a St. Bernard dog from whose little keg of
brandy a traveller, up to the neck in snow, is reviving
himself.</p>

<p>Out of the great scheme in whose aid this remarkable
annual has been published have already sprung two Talbot
Houses, one in Queen's Gate Gardens, and one in St. George's
Square. There is still need of a main headquarters in London
and hostels for its branches, more than sixty of them, spread
all over the country. "'Toc. H.,'" says its Padre, "is not
a charity. Once opened our Hostel Clubs are self-supporting,
as our experience already proves. In Edinburgh, Liverpool,
Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield,
two thousand pounds will open a house for which our
branches in each of these places are crying out. It is only
the original outlay, the furniture and the first quarter's rent,
which stand between us and a whole series of such houses
in the great provincial centres. Fifty pounds will endow a
bedroom, where a lad can live cheaper than in the dingiest
lodgings, and know something better of a great city than
that it is a place where all evil is open to him and all good
is behind closed doors.... 'Toc. H.,' we repeat, is <i>not</i>
another recurrent charity. It is a wise way of helping to
meet our debt of honour; it is a living and growing memorial,
charged with the task of making reincarnate in the younger
world the qualities which saved us."</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> ventures to add his voice to this claim upon our
honour and gratitude; and, if I may, I would like to make
appeal to all who loved the work of our friend who is dead,
that they should send some offering to this good cause as
a personal tribute to the memory of a man who, in his own
form of service, did so much to cheer the hearts of our
fighting men in the dark hours that are over.</p>

<h3>THE FAIRY TAILOR</h3>.

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Sitting on the flower-bed beneath the hollyhocks</p>
<p>I spied the tiny tailor who makes the fairies' frocks;</p>
<p>There he sat a-stitching all the afternoon</p>
<p>And sang a little ditty to a quaint wee tune:</p>
<p class="i2">"Grey for the goblins, blue for the elves,</p>
<p class="i2">Brown for the little gnomes that live by themselves,</p>
<p class="i2">White for the pixies that dance upon the green,</p>
<p class="i2">But where shall I find me a robe for the Queen?"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>All about the garden his little men he sent,</p>
<p>Up and down and in and out unceasingly they went;</p>
<p>Here they stole a blossom, there they pulled a leaf,</p>
<p>And bound them up with gossamer into a glowing sheaf.</p>
<p class="i2">Petals of the pansy for little velvet shoon,</p>
<p class="i2">Silk of the poppy for a dance beneath the moon,</p>
<p class="i2">Lawn of the jessamine, damask of the rose,</p>
<p class="i2">To make their pretty kirtles and airy furbelows.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Never roving pirates back from Southern seas</p>
<p>Brought a store of treasures home beautiful as these;</p>
<p>They heaped them all about him in a sweet gay pile,</p>
<p>But still he kept a-stitching and a-singing all the while:</p>

<h3>THOUGHTS IN A COLD SNAP.</h3>

<p>It is going to be very cold when I
get up, which will be almost immediately&mdash;very
cold indeed. It was zero
yesterday; it may be below the line
to-day, twenty or thirty below the
line&mdash;even more. A little slam, perhaps,
in spades. There are icicles hanging
from the window-frame; and it is a
curious thing, when one comes to think
of it, what a lot of things there are that
rhyme with icicle: tricycle, bicycle,
phthisical, psychical&mdash;no, I am wrong,
not psychical ...</p>

<p>Anyhow, it is going to be very cold.
Some people do not mind the cold.
There are people bathing in the Serpentine
at this moment, I suppose, and
apparently nothing can be done about
it. They ju-just break the ice and
ju-jump in. And yet it is not their ice;
it is the <span class="sc">King's</span>. It seems to me that
it ought to be made illegal, this breaking
of the <span class="sc">King</span>'s ice, like the breaking
of windows in Whitehall. These ice-breakers
seem to me as bad as the
people who say, "It's going to be a
nice old-fashioned Christmas, with Yule-logs
and things." Not that I object to
Yule-logs. I have some in my own
Yule-shed, hand-sawn by myself, though
I am not a good hand-sawyer. When
I get about halfway through, the saw
begins to gnash its teeth and groan at
me. It seems to me that what is
wanted is a machine for turning the
logs round and round while one holds
the saw steady. But there is something
beautiful in burning the Yule-logs
of one's own fashioning that makes
one feel like the sculptor when at last
the living beauty has burst forth under
his chisel from the shapeless stone.
Besides, they are cheaper than coal.</p>

<p>As I say, when people talk of "Yule-logs
and things," it is not the Yule-logs
that I object to. It is the things. Nasty
cold things like clean shirts and collars
and bedroom door-handles&mdash;there ought
to be hot water in bedroom door-handles&mdash;nasty
cold things that make one say
"Ugh." I have a theory that the word
"Ugh" was invented on some such
morning as this. Previously people
had been contented with noises like
"Ouch" and "Ouf" and "Ur-r,"
though they realised how inadequate
they were. And then one day, one very
cold <span style="font-size: 0.7em;"><sup>0</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.7em;">40</span> day, inspiration came to the
frenzied brain of a genius, and he wrote
down that single exquisite heart-cry
and hurried it off to the printer. People
knew then that the supreme mating of
sound and sense, which we have agreed
to call poetry, had once more been
achieved.</p>

<p>But I have wandered a little from the
Serpentine. Has it ever struck you what
people who bathe in the Serpentine on
days like this are like during the rest of
the year?</p>

<p>Suppose it is a balmy spring morning,
a mild temperate afternoon in early
summer, a soft autumn twilight when
everyone else is happy and content,
what are they doing then? Positively
bathed in perspiration, groaning under
the burden of the sun, mopping their
shining foreheads and putting cabbage-leaves
under their hats. And then at last
comes the day they have longed for
and looked forward to all through the
twelve-months' heat-wave, a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>[pg 485]</span>
day forty degrees below the belt. They
spring out of bed and fling wide the
casement. That is what they intend
to do, at least. As a matter of fact, of
course, it is stuck, and they have to
bash it out with a bolster, sending the
icicles clinking into the basement.
"Delicious!" they say, leaning out
and breathing deep. Then they chip a
piece of ice out of the water-jug with
a hammer, rub it on their faces and
begin to shave.</p>

<p>They shave in their cotton pyjamas,
with bare feet, humming a song. Then
they put on old flannels and a blazer,
wrap a towel round their neck, light a
cigarette, pick up a mattock and stroll
to Hyde Park. When they get there
they feloniously break the <span class="sc">King's</span> ice.
Then they "ugh." The mere thought
of these people ughing with a great
splash into the Serpentine makes me
feel ill. When I think of them afterwards
sitting lazily on the bank and
letting the blizzard dry their hair,
basking in the snow for an hour or two
and reading their morning paper, and
every now and then throwing a snowball
or a piece of "ugh" into the water,
I hate them. Nobody ought to be
allowed to bathe in the Serpentine on
days like this except the swans, who
paddle all night to hold the ice at bay.
I wonder if I could get a swan and
keep it in the water-jug.</p>

<p>Half-past eight? Yes, I did hear,
thank you. I am really going to get
up very soon now.</p>

<p>What I am going to do is to make
one tiger-like leap&mdash;tiger-like leap, I say&mdash;for
the bathroom door and turn the
hot-water tap full on until the whole of
the upper part of the house is filled with
steam.</p>

<p>I am going to do it this very moment.
I&mdash;yes&mdash;ugh.</p>

<p>Now I come to think of it a tiger-like
leap would be quite the wrong idea.
I am glad I did not do it. Tigers are
not cold when they leap. "Tiger, tiger,
burning bright." Tiger, tiger&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What did you say? A quarter to
nine? What? And the water-pipes
frozen? <i>Are</i> they?</p>

<p class="indent">Thankugh.</p>

"please don't be dense. I
mean, what are you going

<p>I passed my hand over
my eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said;
"I'm afraid I don't....
Have I been to sleep for

<p>"Tell him," said Margery
impatiently. "You'll have
to start right at the beginning."</p>

<p>I sat down expectantly.</p>

<p>"Well," began Cecilia,
"Christmas is coming and
we shall be full up."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," I
murmured deprecatingly.
"You want me to get some
medicine ready for you?"</p>

<p>"I mean the house will
be full up," explained Cecilia
coldly. "The point is we
must arrange something beforehand&mdash;some
sort of entertainment."</p>

<p>"Good heavens," I said,
"you're not going to hire
the Sisters Sprightly or
anything, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, we are not," said
Cecilia; "not the Sisters
Sprightly nor the Brothers
Bung. We are going to do
it ourselves."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;a Sisters

Cecilia. What will Christopher think

said Cecilia hotly, "if I was going to
wear one; but I'm not."</p>

<p>"Not going to wear a ballet skirt?"
I said. "You surely don't mean to
appear in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're not going to do a Sisters
Sprightly turn at all," shouted Margery:
"nobody ever thought of them
but you."</p>

<p>"Then I give it up," I said helplessly;
"I quite understood you to
say&mdash;&mdash; Then what are you going to
do, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well, we thought at first we'd do
a play, but there were difficulties in the
way."</p>

<p>"Too true," I said; "none of us can
act to begin with."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself," said Margery.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Miss Thorndike," I apologised.</p>

<p>"No, the difficulty is that we haven't
really room for theatricals. We should
have to use the drawing-room, and by
the time you've got a stage and scenery
and rooms for changing, well, there's
simply no space left for the audience,"
explained Cecilia.</p>

<p>"That's no objection at all," I said;
"rather an advantage, in fact."</p>

<p>"And anyhow," continued Margery,
"we haven't got a play to do."</p>

<p>"And so," said Cecilia, "we've decided
to have a concert party."</p>

<p>I gasped.</p>

<p>"Not a concert party," I implored.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cecilia, "a costume
concert party. It isn't any use groaning
like that. It's all arranged. Sheila
and Arthur Davies, Margery, John, you
and I are in it. The question is what
are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I never heard of such a
horrible idea."</p>

<p>"Don't be a pig, Alan," said Margery.</p>

<p>"Really, Cecilia," I said, "let me
plead with you. <i>Not</i> a costume concert
party, please. A simple glee perhaps&mdash;just
four of us&mdash;in evening dress;
or even a conjurer. I'll agree to anything.
But not, <i>not</i> Pierrots, Cecilia."</p>

<p>"Pierrots it is," said Cecilia defiantly.</p>

<p>"Then I wash my hands of it. To
think that our family&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can wash your hands if you
like," said Cecilia; "we should prefer
it, in fact; but you are certainly
going to take part."</p>

<p>I know the futility of arguing
with Cecilia.</p>

<p>"Then tell me the worst,"
I begged; "what am I to
be? Can I show people to
their seats, or am I the
good-looking tenor with
gentlemanly features and
long hair?"</p>

<p>"We thought of making
you the funny man," said
Cecilia.</p>

<p>I buried my head in my
hands and shuddered.</p>

<p>At this moment John
came into the room. "Talking
about the 'Merry Maggots'?"
he said. "Splendid
idea of Cecilia's, isn't it?
I've just been thinking it
over, and what we must decide
on first of all is who is
to be the&mdash;the humourist.
He's the really important
man; must be someone
really first-class."</p>

<p>"We've also been discussing
it," I said quickly,
"and we came to the conclusion
that there's only
one man for the job&mdash;yourself."</p>

<p>John nodded complacently.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear you
say so, because I was going
to suggest it myself. It's my belief that
I should be a devilish funny fellow if I
had a chance. I've just tried a few jokes
on myself upstairs, and I've been simply
roaring with laughter. Haven't enjoyed
myself so much for years."</p>

<p>"Splendid fellow!" I said heartily;
"you shall tell them to me later on
and I'll roar with laughter too. Cecilia,
put your husband down for the funny
man."</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;humourist," corrected John
with a slight cough.</p>

<p>"'Humourist,'" I agreed; "and
thank goodness that's settled."</p>

<p>"But," said Cecilia, "you said you
were going to do a dramatic recitation."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>[pg 489]</span>

<p>"So I am, so I am," said John; "I'm
going to do that as well. Contrast,
my dear Cecilia. Laughter and tears.
Double them up with sly wit one moment
and have them sobbing into their
handkerchiefs the next. I'm going to
do it all, Cecilia."</p>

<p>"So it appears," said Cecilia; "it
hardly seems worth while to have anybody
else in the show."</p>

<p>"Now, now," said John, wagging his
forefinger at her, "no jealousy. You
ought to be glad to have someone really
good in the party. <i>Good</i> funny men
aren't to be found just anywhere."</p>

<p>"But we don't know that you <i>are</i> a
good funny man," said Margery.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," said John;
"I've never had a chance to prove it.
For years I have been kept in the background
by your family. I'm never
allowed to make a joke, and if I do
nobody laughs. This is my chance.
I'm going to be in the limelight now.
I shall be the life of the party, and it's
no good trying to stop me. In fact,"
he finished confidentially, "I shan't be
surprised if I take it up professionally.
You should have heard me laughing
upstairs."</p>

<p>"But, John," began Margery.</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;!" said Cecilia; "it's no use
arguing with him while he's in this
mood. That's all right, John. You
shall be everything you like. But as
you've selected such a lot of parts for
yourself perhaps you'll suggest what
we can do with Alan."</p>

<p>"Ah," said John; "Alan! Yes, he's
a problem, certainly. If he had any
voice, now. I'm not sure that we want
him at all. Could he do a clog-dance,
do you think?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry," I interrupted; "I've
thought of a fine part for me. All the
best concert parties have a chap who
sits in the corner and does nothing but
look miserable. I could do that splendidly."</p>

<p>"That's quite true," said John approvingly;
"it tickles the audience,
you know, to see a fellow looking glum
while everyone else is having hysterics
at the funny&mdash;at the humourist. It
isn't as easy as it looks, though, Alan.
I shall keep saying things to make you
laugh, you know. You'll find it jolly
difficult to keep looking miserable once
I get going."</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said. "That is, I
shall do my best to keep serious. I
shall try not to listen to you being
funny."</p>

<p>John looked at me and considered
whether it was worth following up.
He decided it was not.</p>

<p>"I daresay he'll do," he said loftily
to Cecilia; "the fellow has no sense of
humour anyway."</p>

<h3>THE FINE OLD FRUITY.</h3>

<p>Wine merchants must be kind men.
So many of those who have sent me
their circulars this Christmas-time have
announced that they are "giving their
clients the benefit of some exceptionally
advantageous purchases which they
have made."</p>

<p>But it is not the humanity of wine
merchants of which I wish to speak.
It is the intriguing epithets which they
apply to their wines. And I have entertained
myself by applying these to
my relatives, an exercise which I find
attended by the happiest results.</p>

<p>"Fine old style, rich," is, of course,
obvious. It applies to more than one
of my Victorian uncles. "Medium rich"
to a cousin or so. More subtle is
"medium body." This must be Uncle
Hilary; he takes little exercise nowadays
and his figure is suffering. Soon
he will be "full-bodied" or "full and
round." "Elegant, high class" is my
Cousin Isabel. "Pretty flavour" also
is hers. "Fresh and brisk" is Aunt
Hannah. And could anything be more
descriptive of Aunt Geraldine than
"delicate and generous"?</p>

<p>For "great breed and style" (used, I
see, of a claret) I should, I fear, be obliged
to go outside the family; and "recommended
for present consumption and
for laying down" I only mention because
it leaves me wondering to what
other uses a fine fruity Burgundy could
be put. But here is a noble one: "Of
very high class, stylish, good body and
fine character." I have tried this on
several relations without being entirely
satisfied about it, and I have finally
decided that I shall keep it for myself.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/493-1.png"><img src="images/493-1-300.png" width="300" height="255" alt="And to think it was the best Irish linen!" /></a>
<p><i>The Lord Chancellor.</i> "<span class="sc">And to think it was the best Irish linen!</span>"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Monday, December 13th.</i>&mdash;Since the
House of Lords took the bit in its teeth
and bolted with the Government of
Ireland Bill the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span> has
practically thrown the reins on the
creature's neck and confined
himself to occasional mild remonstrance
when it kicked
over the Government traces.
The most he could do when
rival amendments were put
forward was to secure the
passage of the less objectionable.
Thus when Lord <span class="sc">Shandon</span>,
for purely sentimental
reasons&mdash;Ireland knew him
as "a most susceptible Chancellor"&mdash;desired
that the unifying
body should be called
a Senate Lord <span class="sc">Birkenhead</span>
laughed the proposal out of
court with the remark that
"a man might as well purchase
a mule with the object
of founding a stud," and persuaded
the Peers to accept
the word "Council." He was
at first inclined to oppose
Lord <span class="sc">Wicklow's</span> amendment
providing that neither Irish
Parliament should take private property
without compensation; but when he
found that an old Home Ruler, Lord
<span class="sc">Bryce</span>, was in favour of imposing this
curb on Irish exuberance he, as "a very
young Home Ruler," gracefully withdrew
his objection.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">John Baird</span> revealed
the names of the
members of the Central
Control Board (Liquor
Traffic). The muffled
groans that followed the
announcement of the first
of them, Mr. <span class="sc">Waters-Butler</span>,
were quite uncalled
for, as I understand
that the gentleman in
question preserves a strict
impartiality between
two branches of his patronymic.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span> was
not too sympathetic to
the complaints of overcrowding
on the suburban
railways; but I cannot
think that Mr. <span class="sc">Martin</span>
had fully thought out
the consequences of his
suggestion that the right
hon. gentleman should
take a trip one night from
Aldgate to Barking and
see for himself. Imagine
the feelings of the strap-hangers
when Sir <span class="sc">Eric</span>
essayed "little by little" to wedge himself
into their midst.</p>

<p>If the Opposition desired a really
satisfactory discussion on the origin of
the fires in Cork it should have chosen
some other spokesman than Lieut.-Commander
<span class="sc">Kenworthy</span>. The hon.
and gallant gentleman was less aggressive
in manner than usual, but even
so he encountered a good many interruptions.
He was answered in a
characteristic speech by Mr. <span class="sc">Claude
Lowther</span>; and the debate as a whole
never rose much above the level where
it was left by these "Burnt Cork
Comedians."</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, December 14th.</i>&mdash;Despite
the protests of Lord <span class="sc">Braye</span>, who demanded
full self-determination for Ireland,
the Peers gave a Third Reading to
the Government of Ireland Bill. Lord
<span class="sc">Crewe</span> so far modified his
previous attitude as to congratulate
the Government on
having held on their course
in the face of the discouraging
events in Ireland, and to
express the hope that the
measure would be worked for
all it was worth, though, in
his lordship's estimation, it
was not worth much.</p>

<h4>THE END OF THE OMNIBUS.</h4>
<p><i>Conductor <span class="sc">Addison</span>.</i> "<span class="sc">A nice old mess you've been and
gone and
made!</span>"</p>
<p><i>Driver <span class="sc">Curzon</span>.</i> "<span class="sc"><i>Me?</i> If <i>you</i> hadn't been so
late in turning out I
shouldn't have had to cut things so fine.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>The Ministry of Health
Bill found the Peers in a
much less accommodating
mood. Lord <span class="sc">Strachie</span> moved
its rejection, chiefly on the
ground of the financial strain
it would impose upon local
authorities, and was supported
by Lord <span class="sc">Galway</span>,
who thought it an insult to
Parliament to bring forward
so ambitious a measure at
the fag-end of the Session.
Lord <span class="sc">Curzon</span> vainly endeavoured
to avert the coming storm
by accepting a suggestion that the
Bill should be carried over till next
Session. The majority of the Peers
were out for blood, and they defeated
the Second Reading by 57 to 41. Dr.
<span class="sc">Addison</span>, from the steps of the Throne,
gloomily watched the
overturn of his omnibus.
It is understood that, following
the example of his
distinguished namesake,
he is going to write to
<i>The Spectator</i> about Lord
<span class="sc">Strachie</span>.</p>

<p>So many of the Commons
appeared to have
anticipated the Christmas
holidays that Questions
were run through
at a great pace. Mr.
<span class="sc">Hogge</span>, however, was in
his place all right to know
how it was, after all the
protestations of the Government,
that an official
motor-car containing an
officer and a lady had
been seen outside a toy-shop
in Regent Street.
"Mark how a plain tale
shall set you down," said
Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span> in effect.
The officer was on his
way from an outlying
branch of the War Office
to an important conference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>[pg 494]</span>
in Whitehall; the lady was his private
secretary; the natural route of the
car was <i>vi</i> Regent Street, and the officer
had merely seized the opportunity to
pick up a parcel.</p>

<p>A Supplementary Estimate of six and
a-half millions for the Navy gave the
economists their chance. Mr. G. <span class="sc">Lambert</span>
could not understand why we were
employing more men at the dockyards
than before the War, and suggested that
three or four of the yards might be sold.
This proposal was received with singularly
little enthusiasm by most of the
Members for dockyard constituencies;
but Sir B. <span class="sc">Falle</span> (Portsmouth) handsomely
remarked that Chatham might
well be leased for private enterprise.
The Member for Chatham was not present,
or he would, no doubt, have returned
the compliment.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, December 15th.</i>&mdash;A less
adventurous Minister than Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>
might have funked the task of
justifying to a House of Economists a
Supplementary Army Estimate of forty
millions. But he boldly tackled the
job, and proved to his own satisfaction
that half the liability was a mere
book-entry, and the other half inevitable,
in view of the Empire's commitments.
Sir <span class="sc">Charles Townshend</span>, in
a maiden speech which in the more
flamboyant passages suggested the
collaboration of the <span class="sc">Editor</span> of <i>John
Bull</i>, announced his intention of supporting
the Government "for all I am
worth," and proceeded to demonstrate
that their policy in Mesopotamia had
been wrong from start to finish.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, December 16th.</i>&mdash;I don't
know whether the current rumours of
the <span class="sc">Prime Minister's</span> delicacy are put
about by malignant enemies who hope
that Nature will accomplish what they
have failed to achieve, or by well-meaning
friends who desire to convince the
Aberystwith Sabbatarians that Sunday
golf is essential to his well-being. In
his answers to Questions this afternoon
he showed no signs of failing powers.
When Mr. <span class="sc">Billing</span> accused him of
breaking his pledge that there should be
no more secret diplomacy he modestly
replied that that was not his but President
<span class="sc">Wilson's</span> phrase; and a little later
he informed the same cocksure questioner
that a certain problem was "not
so simple as my hon. friend imagines
most problems are."</p>

<p>An inquiry about the Franco-British
boundaries in the Holy Land led the
<span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> to observe that the
territory delimited was "the old historic
Palestine&mdash;Dan to Beersheba." It
was, of course, a mere coincidence that
the next Question on the Paper related
to the destruction of calves, though not
the golden kind.</p>

<p>The quarter-deck voice in which
Rear-Admiral <span class="sc">Adair</span> thundered for information
regarding the Jutland Papers
so startled Sir <span class="sc">James Craig</span> that, fearing
another salvo if he temporised with
the question, he promptly promised
immediate publication.</p>

<p>Despite a characteristic protest from
Mr. <span class="sc">Devlin</span>, who, as Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>
observed, treats his opponents as if
they were "not only morally bad but
intellectually contemptible," the House
proceeded to consider the Lords' Amendments
to the Home Rule Bill, and dealt
with them by the time-honoured device
of "splitting the difference."</p>

<h3>A FOUL GAME.</h3>

<p>It is Christmas, and here is a nice
little cricket story for the hearth. The
funny thing about it is that it is true.
And the other funny thing about it is
that it was told to me by a huge Rugger
Blue called Eric. (I understand people
can change their names at Confirmation.
Why don't they?)</p>

<p>It was in a College match&mdash;not, I
gather, a particularly serious one. Eric
and his friend Charles were playing for
Balbus College against Caramel College.
Caramel had an "A" team out, and
Balbus, I should think, must have had
about a "K" team ... anyhow, Eric
and Charles were both playing. Eric,
as he modestly said, doesn't bat much,
and Charles doesn't bowl much. Eric
said to Charles, "I bet you a fiver you
won't get six wickets." Charles said
to Eric, "All right; and I bet you a
fiver you won't get a hundred runs."</p>

<p>Then began a hideous series of intrigues.
Caramel were to bat first, and
Eric went to the Balbus captain and
said, "There's a sovereign<sup>*</sup> for you if
Charles doesn't go on to bowl <i>at all</i>."</p>

<p class="note"><sup>*</sup> This is a pre-war story.</p>


<p>"Very well," said the captain, with
a glance of sinister understanding.
"Wouldn't have anyhow," he added
as he pocketed the stake.</p>

<p>Then Charles arrived.</p>

<p>"Two pounds," said the captain.</p>

<p>"What for?" said Charles.</p>

<p>"For ten overs&mdash;four bob an over."</p>

<p>"It's too much," said Charles; "but
there's a sovereign for you if Eric goes
in ninth wicket down."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the captain, with
a glance of devilish cunning. "It's
only one lower than usual. Thank you."</p>

<p>Acting on intuition and their knowledge
of the captain, Eric and Charles
then hotly accused each other of bribery.
Both confessed, and it was agreed to
start fair. Charles was to bowl first
change and Eric was to bat first wicket.
The captain said he would want a lot
of bribing to go back on the original
arrangement, especially if it meant
Charles bowling, but he would do it for
the original price; and, as he already
held the money, Eric and Charles had
to concede the point.</p>

<p>By the way, I am afraid the captain
doesn't come very well out of this, and
I'm afraid it is rather an immoral story;
but my object is to show up the evils
of commercialism, so it is all right.</p>

<p>Pallas Athene came down and stood
by the bowler's umpire while Charles
was bowling, and he got five wickets
quite easily. It was incredible. The
Caramel batsmen seemed to be paralysed.
Then the last man came in, and
the first thing he did was to send up a
nice little dolly catch to Eric at cover-point.
Eric missed it. When I say he
missed it I mean he practically flung it
on the ground. Indeed he rather over-did
it, and the batsman, who was a
sportsman and knew Charles, appealed
to the umpire to say he was really out.
Pallas Athene grabbed the umpire by
the throat, and he said firmly that no
catch had been made.</p>

<p>Then the batsmen made a muddle
about a run and found themselves in
the common but embarrassing position
of being both at the wicket-keeper's end.
The ball had gone to Eric and he had
only to throw it in to Charles, who was
bowling, for Charles to put the wicket
down. But in one of those flashes of
inspiration which betray true genius he
realised that in the circumstances that
was just what Charles would <i>not</i> do.
Direct action was the only thing. So,
ball in hand, he started at high velocity
towards the wicket himself.</p>

<p>He was a Rugger Blue (I told you)
and a three-quarter at that, so he went
fairly fast. However, the batsman saw
that he had a faint hope after all, and
he ran too. It was an heroic race, but
the batsman had less distance to go.
Eric saw that he was losing, and from
a few yards' range he madly flung the
ball at the wicket. He missed the
wicket, but he hit Charles very hard on
the shin, which was something. I fancy
he must have hit Pallas Athene as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>[pg 496]</span>
well, for with the very next ball she
gave Charles his sixth wicket.</p>

<p>By this time the game had resolved
itself into an Homeric combat between
the two protagonists, of which the
main bodies of the Balbus and Caramel
armies were merely neutral spectators&mdash;neutral,
that is, so far as they had
not been hired out for some dastard service
by one or other of the duellists.</p>

<p>When Eric went in it was clear that
Juno had come down to help him, for
he made three runs in eight balls without
being bowled once. Then Charles
came in. His first ball he hit slowly
between mid-off and cover, and he
called for a run. All unsuspecting,
Eric cantered down the pitch. When
he was half-way Charles seemed to be
seized with the sort of panic which
sometimes possesses a batsman. "No,
no!" he cried. "Go back! go back!"
And he scuttled back himself. Juno
fortunately intervened and Eric just got
home in time. But he realised now
what he was up against. His next ball
he hit towards mid-wicket, and shouting
"Come on!" he galloped up the
pitch. Charles came on gingerly, expecting
to be sent back, but Eric duly
passed him; he then turned round and
just raced Charles back to the wicket-keeper's
end. Charles was only a Soccer
Blue (and a goal-keeper at that), and
Eric won.</p>

<p>"After that," said Eric with his usual
modesty, "it was easy." Eyewitnesses,
however, have told me more. Juno
dealt with the Caramel bowlers, but
Eric had to compete with Charles. And
Charles resorted to every kind of devilish
expedient. Nearly all the Balbus batsmen
were bribed to run Eric out, and
whenever he hit a boundary Eric had
to stop and reason with them in the
middle of the pitch. Sometimes he tried
to outbid Charles, but he usually found
that he couldn't afford it. So he collared
the bowling as much as possible
and tried not to hit anything but boundaries.
Juno helped him a good bit in
that way.</p>

<p>When he had made seventy he got
a ball on the knee. Charles ran out
and offered to run for him, but Eric
said he could manage, thank you. Then
Charles went and walked rapidly up
and down in front of the screen; but
Eric wasn't the sort of batsman who
minded that.</p>

<p>At about ninety, Eric's knee was
pretty bad, so he called out for somebody
to run for him&mdash;<i>not</i> Charles. Five
of Charles's hirelings rushed out of the
pavilion, but the captain said he would
go himself, as that wasn't fair. Besides,
he had money on Eric himself.</p>

<p>At this point I gather that Pallas
Athene must have deserted Charles altogether,
for he seems to have entertained
for a moment or two the ignoble
notion of tampering with the scorer.
I am glad to be able to say that even
the members of the Balbus College "K."
Team, eaten up as they were by this
time with commercialism, declined to
be parties to that particular wickedness.
With every circumstance of popular
excitement Eric's hundredth run&mdash;a
mis-cue through the slips&mdash;was finally
made, scored and added up. In fact,
he carried his bat.</p>

<p>"So you were all square," I said, not
without admiration.</p>

<p>"By no means," said Eric. "It cost
me forty shillings."</p>

<p>"And Charles?"</p>

<p>"It cost him seven pounds."</p>

<h3>"SUGGESTIONS."</h3>

<h4><span class="sc1">A Warning</span>.</h4>

<p>Entering as we are upon the season
of games, it might be well to utter an
urgent appeal to hostesses not to play
"Suggestions." For "Suggestions,"
though it may begin as a game, is
really a wrangle. Under the guise of
a light-hearted pastime it offers little
but opportunities for misunderstanding,
general conversation, allegations of unfairness,
and disappointment.</p>

<p>"Suggestions" ought to be played
like this: You sit in a semicircle and
the first player says something&mdash;anything&mdash;a
single word. Let us suppose
it is (as it probably will be in thousands
of cases) "<span class="sc">Margot</span>." The next player
has to say what "<span class="sc">Margot</span>" suggests&mdash;"reticence,"
for example&mdash;and the next
player, shutting his mind completely
to the word "<span class="sc">Margot</span>," has to say
what "reticence" suggests&mdash;perhaps
<i>Grimaud</i>, in <i>The Three Musketeers</i>&mdash;and
the fourth player has to disregard
"reticence" and announce whatever
mental reaction the name of <i>Grimaud</i>
produces. It maybe that he has never
heard of <i>Grimaud</i> and the similarity
of sound suggests only <span class="sc">Grimaldi</span> the
clown. Then he ought to say, "<span class="sc">Grimaldi</span>
the clown," which might in its turn
suggest "melancholy" or "the circus."
All the time no one should speak but
the players in their turn, and they
should speak instantly and should say
nothing but the thing that is honestly
suggested by the previous word. At
the end of, say, a dozen rounds the
process of unwinding the coil begins,
each player in rotation taking part in
the backward process until "<span class="sc">Margot</span>"
is again reached.</p>

<p>That is how the game should be
played.</p>

<p>This is how it <i>is</i> played:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Player.</i> Let me see; what shall
I say?</p>

<p><i>Various other Players (together).</i> Surely
there's no difficulty in beginning? Say
"anything," etc., etc.</p>

<p><i>A Player (looking round).</i> Say&mdash;say
"fireplace."</p>

<p><i>First Player.</i> But that's so silly.</p>

<p><i>Master of Ceremonies (who wishes
he had never proposed the game).</i> It
doesn't matter. All that is needed is a
start.</p>

<p><i>Another player.</i> Say "<span class="sc">Margot</span>."</p>

<p>(<i>Roars of laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Oh, yes, say "<span class="sc">Margot</span>."</p>

<p><i>First Player.</i> Very well, then&mdash;"<span class="sc">Margot</span>."</p>

<p>(<i>More laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Second Player (trying to be clever).</i>
"Reticence."</p>

<p>(<i>Shouts of laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Other Players.</i> How could "<span class="sc">Margot</span>"
suggest "reticence"?</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> Never mind; the point is that
it did. Now then&mdash;and please everyone
be silent&mdash;now, then, Third Player?</p>

<p><i>Third Player.</i> "Audacity."</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> I'm afraid you're not playing
quite fairly. You see "reticence" cannot
suggest "audacity." The First
Player's word not impossibly might.
Could it be that you were still thinking
of that?</p>

<p><i>Third Player.</i> I'm sorry. But "reticence"
doesn't suggest anything.</p>

<p><i>Other Players (together).</i> Oh, yes, it does&mdash;"silence,"
"grumpiness," "oysters,"
"Trappists."</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> If a word suggests nothing
whatever to you, you should say,
"Blank mind."</p>

<p><i>Third Player.</i> Ah, but I've thought
of something now&mdash;"reticule."</p>

<p>(<i>Roars of laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> It's all right. That's how
the mind does work. Now, next player.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Player.</i> Have I got to say
something that "reticule" suggests?</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> That's the idea&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><i>A Player.</i> Say "vanity-bag."</p>

<p><i>Another Player.</i> Say "powder-puff."</p>

<p>(<i>Roars of laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> Please, please&mdash;either the game
is worth playing or it isn't. If it is
worth playing it is worth playing seriously,
and then you can get some very
funny effects&mdash;it's a psychological exhibition;
but if other players talk at the
same time and try to help it's useless.
Now, next player, please. The word is
"reticule."</p>

<p><i>Fourth Player (after a long silence).</i>
"Bond Street."</p>

<p><i>Fifth Player.</i> Ah, "Bond Street"!
That's better. That suggests heaps of
things. Which shall I choose? "Chocolates"?
No. "Furs"? No. "Diamonds"?
No. Oh, yes&mdash;"Old Masters."</p>

<p><i>M. C. (with resignation).</i> But you
know you mustn't select. The whole
point of the game is that you must say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id="page497"></a>[pg 497]</span>
what comes automatically into your
mind as you hear the word.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Player.</i> I'm sorry. Shall I go
back to "diamonds"?</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> No; you had better stick to
"Old Masters."</p>

<p><i>Fifth Player.</i> "Old Masters."</p>

<p><i>Sixth Player (deaf).</i> What did you
say&mdash;"mustard-plasters"?</p>

<p><i>Fifth Player.</i> No; "Old Masters."</p>

<p><i>Sixth Player.</i> I've heard of new men
and old acres, but I've never heard of
Old Pastures. What are they?</p>

<p><i>Fifth Player (shouting).</i> No, no;
"Old Masters." Pictures of the Old
Masters&mdash;<span class="sc">Raphael</span>, <span class="sc">Titian</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Player.</i> Ah, yes! "Old Masters."
Well, that suggests to me&mdash;&mdash; Yes
(<i>triumphantly</i>), "the National Gallery."</p>

<p><i>Seventh Player (who has been waiting
sternly).</i> "Trafalgar Square."</p>

<p><i>Eighth Player (instantly).</i> "<span class="sc">Nelson</span>."</p>

<p><i>Ninth Player (even more quickly).</i>
"<span class="sc">Nelson Keys</span>."</p>

<p><i>M. C. (beaming).</i> That's better. It's
going well now.</p>

<p><i>Tenth Player.</i> "England expects&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Ninth Player.</i> No, you can't say that.
I could have said that, but you can't.</p>

<p><i>Tenth Player.</i> Why not?</p>

<p><i>Ninth Player.</i> Because "<span class="sc">Nelson</span>" is
all over and done with. The new name
is "<span class="sc">Nelson Keys</span>." You ought to have
thought of something connected with
him.</p>

<p><i>Tenth Player.</i> If you'd said "<span class="sc">Keys</span>"
I might have done. But you said
"<span class="sc">Nelson Keys</span>," and the "<span class="sc">Nelson</span>"
touched a spot. Isn't that right?</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> Quite right. It's the only way
to play. But may I once more ask that
there should be no talking? We shall
never be able to unwind if there is.
Now, please&mdash;"England expects&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Eleventh Player.</i> "Duty."</p>

<p><i>Twelfth Player.</i> "Bore."</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth Player.</i> "The Marne."</p>

<p>(<i>Cries of astonishment.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Various Players.</i> How can "bore"
suggest "the Marne"?</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> But it did. You mustn't mind.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth Player.</i> How did it? Just
for fun I'd like to know.</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth Player.</i> Well, when I was
on the Marne I used to see the marks
on the ground made by them.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth Player.</i> By who?</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth Player.</i> The wild boars.</p>

<p>(<i>Roars of laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twelfth Player.</i> But I meant that
duty is a bore&mdash;b-o-r-e.</p>

<p><i>M. C. (frantic).</i> It doesn't matter.
It's what you think&mdash;not what is&mdash;in
this game. But really we're in such a
muddle, wouldn't it be better to begin
again? You all know the rules now.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Perhaps "Clumps" might
be better, don't you think?</p>

<p><i>M. C.</i> Just as you like. "Clumps,"
then.</p>

<p><i>The Deaf Player.</i> What is the word
now?</p>

<p><i>A Player.</i> We're going to play
"Clumps" instead.</p>

<p><i>The Deaf Player.</i> Mumps in bed?
I'm sure I don't know what that suggests.
That's very difficult. But I
like this game. It ought to be great
fun when we unwind.</p>

<p>(<i>They separate for "Clumps."</i>)</p>

<h3>MISPLACED BENEVOLENCE.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;From your earliest
years you have preached sound and
wholesome doctrine on the duty of man
to birds and beasts. Indeed, I remember
your pushing it to extreme lengths in
a poem entreating people not to mention
mint-sauce when conversing with
a lamb. Still, I wonder whether even
you would approve of the title of an
article in <i>Nature</i> on "The Behaviour
of Beetles." Of course I know that
"behaviour" is a colourless word, still
I am rather inclined to doubt whether
beetles know how to behave at all. I
may be prejudiced by my own experiences,
but they certainly have been
unfortunate. They began early&mdash;at my
private school, to be precise. I shall
never forget the conversation I had,
when a new boy, with a sardonic senior
who, after putting me through the usual
catechism, asked me what I was going
to be. I replied that I had not yet
decided, whereupon my tormentor, after
looking at my feet, which I have never
succeeded in growing up to, observed,
"Well, if I were you, I think I should
emigrate to Colorado and help to crush
the beetle." Later on in life I was the
victim of a cruel hoax, carried out with
triumphant ingenuity by a confirmed
practical joker, who with the aid of a
thread caused what appeared to be a
gigantic blackbeetle to perform strange
and unholy evolutions in my sitting-room.
Worst of all, I was victimised
by the presence of a blackbeetle in a
plate of clear soup served me at my
club. I backed my bill, but it was too
late, for I am very shortsighted.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Punch, I am prepared to discuss
the Ethics of Eels, the Altruism
of Adders, the Piety of Pintails, or even
the Benevolence of Bluebottles, but (to
deviate into doggerel)&mdash;</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p>So charged is it with liable-to-go-off controversy that I
should hardly have been astonished to see Mr. <span class="sc">H. G. Wells's</span>
latest volume, <i>Russia in the Shadows</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and
Stoughton</span>),
embellished with the red label of "Explosives." Probably
everyone knows by now the circumstances of its
origin, and how Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span> and his son are (for the moment)
the rearguard in that long procession of unprejudiced
and undeceivable observers who have essayed to pluck the
truth about Russia from the bottom of the Bolshevist pit.
What Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span> found is much what was to be expected:
red ruin, want and misery unspeakable. The difference
between his report and those of most of his forerunners is
that, being (as one is apt to forget) a highly-trained writer,
he is able to present it with a technical skill that enormously
helps the effect. Our author having been unable to
deny the shadow, like everyone else save perhaps the preposterous
Mr. <span class="sc">Lansbury</span>, the only outstanding question is
who casts it. The ordinary man would probably have
little hesitation about his answer to that. Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span> has
even less. He unhesitatingly names you and me and the
French investors and several editors. Well, I have no
space for more than an indication of what you will find in
this undeniably vigorous and vehement little volume. But
I must not forget the photographs. Some of these, of devastated
streets and the like, have rather lost their novelty.
Unfortunately, however, for Mr. <span class="sc">Wells</span> as propagandist
he has also included a number of the most revealing portraits
yet available of the men who are hag-riding a once
great nation to the abyss. I can only say that for me
those portraits put the finishing touch to Mr. <span class="sc">Wells's</span> argument.
They extinguish it.</p>

<hr />

<p>The pictorial wrapper of <i>A Man of the Islands</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>)
is embellished with a drawing of a coffee-coloured lady
in a costume that it would be an under-statement to call
curtailed, also (inset, as the picture-papers say) the portrait
of a respectable-looking gentleman in a beard. In the
printed synopsis that occupies the little tuck-in part of the
same wrapper you are promised "an entrancing picture of
breaking seas on lonely islands and tropical nights beneath
the palms." In other words Mr. <span class="sc">H. de Vere Stacpoole</span> as
before. Lest however you should suppose the insularity of
this attractive pen-artist to be in danger of becoming overdone,
I will say at once that the six tales from which the
book takes its name occupy not much more than a third of
it, the rest being filled with stories of varied setting
bearing such titles as "The Queen's Necklace," "The Box
of Bonbons," and the like&mdash;all frankly to be grouped under
the head of "Financial Measures." This said, it is only
fair to add that the half-dozen <i>Sigurdson</i> adventures&mdash;he
was the Man of the Islands, a bearded trader, murderer,
pearl thief and what not&mdash;seem to me a group of as rattling
good yarns as of their kind one need wish to meet, every
one with some original and thrilling situation that lifts it
far above pot-boiling status. I could wish (despite anything
above having a contrary sound) that Mr. <span class="sc">Stacpoole</span>
had given us a whole volume with that South Sea setting
that so happily stimulates his fancy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">S. P. B. Mais</span> has not yet extricated himself from
the groove into which he has fallen. It is not a wholesome
groove, and even if it were I should not wish an author of
his capacity to remain a perpetual tenant of it. In <i>Colour
Blind</i> (<span class="sc">Grant Richards</span>) we are given the promiscuous
amours of a schoolmaster, a subject which has apparently
a peculiar attraction for Mr. <span class="sc">Mais</span>. <i>Jimmy Penruddocke</i>,
who tells the story, left the Army and could not find a job
until he was offered a mastership at a public school. The
school rather than <i>Jimmy</i> has my sympathies. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>[pg 500]</span>
nothing peculiarly alluring about this philanderer to account
for the devastating magnetism which he exerted upon the
female heart. To describe all this orgy of caresses could
hardly have been worth anyone's time and trouble; certainly
it was not worth Mr. <span class="sc">Mais's</span>. I say this with all the more
assurance because, greatly as I dislike the main theme of
this novel, there are many good things in it. There is, for
example, <i>Mark Champernowne</i> (<i>Jimmy's</i> friend), a finely
and consistently drawn character, and there are descriptive
passages which are vividly beautiful and also some delightful
gleams of humour. I think that when Mr. <span class="sc">Mais's</span> sense of
humour has developed further he will agree with me that a
man who loved as promiscuously as <i>Jimmy</i> and then wrote
over three hundred pages about it could, without much
straining of the truth, be called a cad.</p>

<hr />

<p>For many reasons I could wish that England were China.
It would be nice, for instance, to address the <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span>
as "Redoubtable Hunter of Criminals" and to call
the Board of Exterior
Affairs (if we had one)
"Wai-wo-poo." I
should like my house
also to be named "The
Palace of the Hundred
Flowers." I think there
are about a hundred,
though I have not
counted them. But in
China it is above all
things necessary to be
an ancestor, and this
may lead to complications
if Mr. <span class="sc">G. S. de
Morant</span>, who appears
to be much more at
home with the French
and the Oriental idiom
than the English, is
to be trusted. <i>In the
Claws of the Dragon</i>
(<span class="sc">Allen and Unwin</span>)
describes the experiences
of a young lady
named <i>Monique</i>, who married the Secretary to the Chinese
Embassy in Paris and was obliged, after visiting her relations-in-law,
to reconcile herself to the introduction of a
second wife into the family, in order that their notions of
propriety might be respected and an heir born to the line.
When she had consented she returned to Paris and wrote
the following cablegram from her own mother's house:
"You have acted as a good son and a faithful husband.
Bring back with you the mother of our (<i>sic</i>) child." And
so, the author evidently feels, it all ended happily. His
book is an interesting and amusing presentment of an older
civilisation, but if it won't strain the <i>Entente</i> I am bound
to say that I disagree with his conclusions.</p>

<hr />

<p>I fear it may sound an unkindly criticism, but my abiding
trouble with <i>Broken Colour</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) was an inability to get
any of the characters, with perhaps one exception, to come
alive or behave otherwise than as parts of a thoroughly
nice-mannered and unsensational story. Perhaps it was
my own fault. Mr. <span class="sc">Harold Ohlson</span> (whose previous book
I liked) has obviously, perhaps a little too obviously, done
his best for these people. It is a tale of two rivalries: that
for the heroine, between the penniless artist-hero and a
pound-full other; and that in the breast of the p.a.h.,
between the flesh-pots of commerce and the world-well-lost-for-Chelsea.
It is typical of Mr. <span class="sc">Ohlson's</span> care that, though
one would in such a situation nine times out of ten be safe
in backing Art for the double event, he makes so even a
match of it between <i>Hubert</i> and <i>Ralph</i> that he leaves the
heroine ringing the door-bell of the one immediately after
kissing the other. You observe that I was perhaps really
more interested in the contest than my opening words would
suggest, but it was always in a detached story-book way;
except in the case of a mildly unsympathetic secretary,
represented as having spent too much time in the contemplation
of other persons' affluence, also as owning an
expensive-looking stick that made him long to be as rich
as it caused him to appear. I hate to think that there can
have been anything here to touch a chord in the reviewing
breast, but the fact remains that <i>Mr. Burnham</i> stands out
for me as the only genuinely human figure in the book.</p>

<hr />

<p>Blessed, no doubt, is the nation or the man without a
history, but blessed too is the biographer who has something
definite to write about.
Mr. <span class="sc">C. Carlisle Taylor</span>,
in putting together
his <i>Life of Admiral
Mahan</i> (<span class="sc">Murray</span>), the
American naval philosopher
and prophet, must
have felt this keenly,
for rarely can a man
whose work was so important
that he simply
had to have a biography
have done so
few things of the kind
that help to fill up a
book. The Admiral
not only foresaw the
great War before 1914;
he even suggested definite
details of it&mdash;for
instance, the loyalty of
Italy to Western civilisation
and the final surrender
of the German
fleet; yet in himself,
though the writer draws an attractive picture of his
home and religious life, he was only a kindly Christian
gentleman who lectured to a few naval students. This
is not the stuff to turn into a thrilling life-story, yet his
studies on <i>Sea-Power</i> in relation to national greatness
must certainly be reckoned among the prime causes of world-war.
They set the Germans trying to outbuild the British
fleet; more fortunately they were an inspiration to naval
enthusiasts in this country also. Mr. <span class="sc">Taylor</span> has a pleasant
chapter describing the immediate recognition and welcome
his hero received in England, while it has taken quite a
number of chapters to do justice to all the written tributes
to his genius that the energetic author has collected. Personally,
if ever I had been in doubt about it, I should have
been quite willing to take that genius for granted some time
before the end, and could indeed recommend the volume much
more happily if it were reduced by about half. It will be
valuable mainly as a necessary work of reference.</p>

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
